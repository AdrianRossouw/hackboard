        NARRATOR

    Unlike his .siblings, Penelope didn't like how his .parents always bossed
    him around. "Stand over there", they'd say. "Repaint", they'd say.

    Penelope yearned for more.

Focus out on the whole layout, with thomas jumping out and landing on the
floor with a thud

    More than anything else, thomas dreamed of being famo.us
